  Add $header option for csv and tsv, output header or not

  Add the following instant methods
    fromSQLi
    fromCSVi
    fromTSVi
  so that these methods can be inherited.
  Thanks to Michael Schlueter

  Update new method, so that it can be used as an instant method as well.

  Add method
    rowHashRef
  which returns a copy of a table row in hash reference.

  Officially support TSV format via the following three methods
    Data::Table::fromTSV
    fromTSVi
    tsv
  Read "TSV FORMAT" section for details.

1.18
  Fix the problem in Data::Table::fromCSV caused by null trailing fields.
  E.g., a line "a,b,," in a csv file was split into two fields before.
  Thanks to Karsten

  Fix the warning message in Data::Table::match_string, when table contains
  an undef element.

  Add Data::Table::fromTSV and Data::Table:tsv
  TSV - tab-deliminated file format. TSV preserves NULL element and line-break
  chars in a table.
    \0, \\, \r, \b, \n, \t are slash-escaped.
    undef is escaped into \N.
  This is based on MySQL specification.
