Revision history for Perl extension Data::Table.

1.54 Sun Feb 10 21:35:02 PST 2008
  Modify fromFileGetTopLines method, remove dependency on bytes
  bytes::substr causes infinite loop in some older version of perl

1.53 Thu Jan  3 21:13:40 PST 2008
  add "use bytes" to Table.pm
  Just patched test.pl, because some OS cannot open in-memory file.

1.52 Fri Dec 14 11:48:42 PST 2007
1.51 Wed Dec 12 15:36:22 PST 2007
  1. Add a class methods Data::Table::fromFile(file_name), which can
  guess the file format and call fromCSV/fromTSV internally.
  
  fromFile relies on the following new methods
    fromFileGuessOS(file_name)
    fromFileGetTopLines($file_name, $OS, $lineNumber)
    fromFileIsHeader($string)
    fromFileGuessDelimiter($arrayRefToLines)
  to figure out if the input file is from UNIX/PC/MAC, whether its first
  row contains column headers, and whether it uses ",", "\t" or ":" as
  field delimiters.
  It then calls either fromCSV or fromTSV to return the table object.

  $t = Data::Table::fromFile("myFileName_CSVorTSV_HeaderOrNoHeader_UNIXorPCorMAC");
    
  Please refers to the updated document for details.

  2. When fromFile/fromCSV/fromTSV reads from an empty file, it returns
  an undef object, rather than quit.

  3. Provide more informative error message, when invalid column header is found.

  4. fixed a bug in 1.51 where fromFileGuessOS failed in Windows
  Thanks to patches provided by "whitebell".

1.50 Thu Sep 28 07:21:38 PDT 2006
  Small modifications to sort subroutine example in the document, no bug.

  join method, if $cols2 is undefined, defaults @$cols2 to @$cols1
  Update fromCSV, fromTSV, csv methods to be able to deal with certain delimiters correctly.
    (When the delimiter is a special symbol for regexp, it should be escaped, e.g., set delimiter to '\|' for pipe symbol).
  Thanks to suggestions from Michael Slaven.

  update fromCSV, fromTSV to take additional arguments: skip_lines and skip_pattern
  skip_lines lets user skip several lines in the beginning of the input file
  skip_pattern lets user skip all lines that match a regular expression
  Please read documents under fromCSV and fromTSV for details.
  Thanks to suggestions from Wenbin Ye.

1.49 Wed Aug 30 09:29:51 PDT 2006
  Add %Data::Table::DEFAULTS to store the default settings for OS, CSV_DELIMITER and CSV_QUALIFIER
  Thanks to suggestions from Roman Filippov

  Patch sort method to deal with undef table element. undef value is considered to be
  larger than any other value, two undef values are considered equal during sorting.

1.48 Thu Jun  8 13:25:54 PDT 2006
  Update fromCSV, parseCSV to enable user-specified delimiter and qualifier,
  see document and examples under fromCSV.
  csvEscape is modified accordingly.
  Thanks to help from Roman Filippov

1.47 Sun May 21 15:03:14 PDT 2006
  Upload the wrong code in 1.46, re-upload

1.46 Sat May 13 05:44:09 PDT 2006
  fromCSV, fromTSV, csv, tsv can all take either a file hander or a file name
  Notice: to leave rooms for future development, file handler is not closed by Data::Table.
          It's caller's responsibility to close it afterwards, if no longer used.
  table::sort code is replaced, the old sort method is renamed to sort_v0 and is deprecated.
  The new sort method allow user-defined sorting operators, please read manual on table::sort
  The new sort method also runs faster in some benchmark tests.
  A big thank to Wenbin Ye for suggestions, as well as contributing
    both the new sort code and test examples

1.45 Mon May  1 09:08:20 PDT 2006
  Fix a bug in fromTSV
  last column name is truncated by one character (introduced in 1.44)
  Thanks to Albert V. Smith

1.44 Sat Apr 15 04:27:28 PDT 2006
  Fix a bug in join (type=2 and 3)
  When right or full join, key fields are undef for right-only entries.

  modify fromCSV, fromTSV, tsv, csv subroutines to support read/write PC, Mac and UNIX files.
  csv and tsv can take a file name and directly writes to it.

1.43 Tue Nov  9 10:23:44 PST 2004
  Patch html so that valid XHTML code is generated
  Several mispelled words were corrected
  Thanks all to Wolfgang Dautermann

1.42 Fri Oct  8 11:56:41 PDT 2004
  Minor changes to group and pivot, not a bug

1.41 Thu Oct  7 14:04:17 CDT 2004
  Add two useful methods: group and pivot
  group can make the records unique based on given key columns
  pivot is handy to transfer database table into a more user readable format
  group+pivot make accounting operations easy, please read the document for details.

1.30 Wed Sep 19 20:02:52 PDT 2001
  Improve header method, which can now take a new header argument.

  Fix a bug in adding a new column to a empty table.
  Thanks to Serge Batalov.

1.29  Mon Sep 17 18:18:13 CDT 2001

  Thanks to Bryan Coon.

1.19  Sat Feb 24 23:23:37 PST 2001
  A bug in fromSQL is fixed (caused by typo)
    This happens when user use the third argument (a reference to an array).
    The old package will show an error message in some cases.

  Add $header option for csv and tsv, output header or not

  Add the following instant methods
    fromSQLi
    fromCSVi
    fromTSVi
  so that these methods can be inherited.
  Thanks to Michael Schlueter

  Update new method, so that it can be used as an instant method as well.

  Add method
    rowHashRef
  which returns a copy of a table row in hash reference.

  Officially support TSV format via the following three methods
    Data::Table::fromTSV
    fromTSVi
    tsv
  Read "TSV FORMAT" section for details.

1.18
  Fix the problem in Data::Table::fromCSV caused by null trailing fields.
  E.g., a line "a,b,," in a csv file was split into two fields before.
  Thanks to Karsten

  Fix the warning message in Data::Table::match_string, when table contains
  an undef element.

  Add Data::Table::fromTSV and Data::Table:tsv
  TSV - tab-deliminated file format. TSV preserves NULL element and line-break
  chars in a table.
    \0, \\, \r, \b, \n, \t are slash-escaped.
    undef is escaped into \N.
  This is based on MySQL specification.

  Package name changed from Table to Data::Table, due to
  name collision with PerlQt

  submitted to CPAN
